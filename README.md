# Introduction

A web app that serves up expense reports.  The main goal is to play around with web technologies.

# Tech used

TODO: create link to branches

## Node.js, HTML5, AngularJS

Switched from Scala to Node.js in an attempt to:
* lower the memory footprint
* learn something about JavaScript/Node.js, which isn't something I've used overly much

## Scala (Play), HTML5, AngularJS, node-webkit

First attempt.  Scala+Play backend.  HTML5+AngularJS frontend.  Brought in node-webkit to tie to create a fat client while leveraging most of the existing codebase.
